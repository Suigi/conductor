TIL:

* Interesting to be on the other side of explainer-to-explainee
* Explaining in a way that people understand is hard
* Concerned about threads
* we like that pieces already look testable
* TerminalUi easier to work with (and test) than Spring Shell
* Nullables!
* Still more infra to be wrapped (Scheduler, Time?, Threads?)
* We don't have figured out how to wire the application together
* Worried that there's not enough behavior in the app
* We're missing Ted

Next Time:

* Sequence diagram for control flow (to help with the wiring)
* Fix multi-screen-share horribleness
